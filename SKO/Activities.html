            In our class, we explored concrete poetry, which was new to me. Although I couldn't find examples from South Korea, I discovered the
            interesting poem "Blues" by bpNichol. The reversal of the word "love" and the repetition of the letter "e" to create sound were clever.
             To me, each word seemed like a person, but I believe everyone finds their own meaning in it.  </p>
             <p class="activities image-description">
            Brainstorming words on the screen using the Crazy 8 method, and then writing code, were entirely new experiences for me. It felt like
             learning a foreign language, complete with its own system and rules. Using my sketch as a guide, I had to communicate with the 
             machine in very specific terms about what actions to take. </p>
             <p class="activities image-description">
             We selected texts from “OK texts from metadata” and made concrete 
             poetry-inspired sketches. My text was “We cannot process your information. Your information is corrupt and needs cleansing. Erase
              brain? OK.” I illustrated a funnel shape to suggest information not processing</p>
             <p class="activities image-description">
            The three images are from our retro game prototype activity. We went through the stages of ideation, sketching, explaining how it 
            works, and testing each other's prototypes. It was fascinating to see how different users approached the game in unexpected ways.
             I learned that giving clear instructions is important for a good user experience.</p>

        <div class="activities image-text-container">
            <p class="activities image-description">This week, we did a fun activity where we each drew an object and then wrote instructions on
             how to recreate it—without revealing what the drawing was. The instructions had to be precise, like “draw a line,” “make a square,” 
             “add dots,” and so on, as if we were explaining it to a machine. Then, someone else would try to recreate the drawing based on those 
             steps.
             It was a new experience for me, as I’m not used to thinking in such a step-by-step, precise way. I realised that simple and clear
              instructions are always the answer. </p>

        <div class="activities image-text-container">
            <p class="activities image-description">This week, we shared our work-in-progress paper prototypes, which gave us a chance to test
                 each other's designs. Testing with different peers brought valuable feedback and sparked new ideas. It’s always fascinating to
                  see different perspectives—many had approaches I wouldn’t have considered. I gathered a few really insightful feedback.

                We also did a Crazy 8 sketch exercise for our SKO. Honestly, I didn’t have any specific ideas, so I just let myself sketch without
                 overthinking. Maybe this is what the Crazy 8 method is all about.</p>

        <div class="activities image-text-container">
        <p class="activities image-description">In the morning, we explored 3D works and tools, considering how we might use them in our p5.js 
            projects. The possibilities for this project are exciting, though I’m a bit concerned about the time needed and whether my coding 
            skills are up to the task. We shared our prototypes again, and since I’ve changed my initial design, this feedback session was 
            especially helpful. We also discussed our SKO plans, and some people have already started coding. 
            We learned about CSS grid containers, and  also discussed our SKO plans. HTML and CSS feel much simpler and more straightforward 
            compared to p5.js.</p>
