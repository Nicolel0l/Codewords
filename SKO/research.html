        <h2 class="research-heading">1. What is creative coding?</h2>
        <div class="research image-text-container">
            <p class="research image-description">
                Creative coding is a programming approach focused on artistic expression rather than practical functionality. It’s used for 
                digital art, interactive installations, live visuals, and experimental video games.
            </p>
            <p class="research image-description">
                The story of creative coding starts in the 1960s. Ivan Sutherland developed
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad" target="_blank">Sketchpad</a> in 1963, one of the first graphical computer
                 programs. Sketchpad let people draw and move shapes on a screen, paving the way for future graphic design tools. In the late
                  60s, groups like  <a href="https://monoskop.org/Compos_68" target="_blank">Compos 68</a> started showing coded artworks in exhibitions. Then, in the 80s, the demoscene emerged, where
                   programmers made impressive visual demos to showcase their skills.</p>

            </div> 
            <p class="research image-description">
                I chose the Manifesto for the Unstable Media by V2_ and looked into their background. 
                <a href="https://v2.nl/articles/manifesto-for-the-unstable-media" target="_blank">V2_</a> is a Dutch organisation, also known
                 as the Lab for the Unstable Media, founded in 1981. They explore the connections between art, technology, and society. It’s 
                 a place where artists, designers, and tech experts come together to see how technology affects our lives. V2_ promotes creative
                  and critical thinking about how technology shapes our world.
            </p>
            <p class="research image-description">
                In 1987, V2_ wrote the Manifesto for the Unstable Media. This manifesto is all about "unstable media" like sound, video, and 
                electronics, which are always changing. V2_ sees the creative potential in these dynamic technologies rather than sticking to
                 traditional, fixed art forms. They suggest that artists should embrace chaos and instability to grow, challenge norms, and 
                 explore new ideas.
            </p>
            <p class="research image-description">
                Their powerful message, "ART MUST BE DESTRUCTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE," resonated with me. As a communication designer, I believe
                 we need to challenge existing rules and norms to come up with better ideas. V2_'s work is unique, experimental, and full of 
                 the spirit of embracing chaos.

        <h2 class="research-heading">3. Digital Media in the late 1980s </h2>
        <div class="research image-text-container"></a>
        <p class="research image-description">
            The manifesto was written in 1987, and I was curious about what was happening in the 1980s, especially in digital media. There were big developments 
            in the late 80s. Many people started buying personal computers, and designers started using digital tools. Programs like
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint" target="_blank">MacPaint</a> (1984), Adobe Illustrator (1987), and Photoshop (1988)
              came out.</p>

        <h2 class="research-heading">4. Video Art and Nam June Paik</h2>
        <div class="research image-text-container">
        <p class="research image-description">

         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_art#:~:text=Video%20art%20is%20an%20art,became%20available%20outside%20corporate%20broadcasting." target="_blank">
         Video art</a> started in the 1960s, giving artists a new way to create installations, performances, and experimental films. 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_June_Paik" target="_blank">Nam June Paik</a> was a key figure in this movement, known for
          his innovative use of video technology. I had heard of him, but didn’t realise his global impact. He famously said, “The future is now,”
           showing his forward-thinking approach to art and technology.</p>

         <p class="research image-description">
         One of Paik's most notable works is <a href="https://www.fondazionebonotto.org/en/collection/poetry/paiknamjune/video/9798.html" target="_blank">"Good Morning, Mr. Orwell" 
        (1984)</a>. This live performance was broadcast via satellite, allowing viewers across multiple continents to watch simultaneously. 
        This was a remarkable technical achievement at the time, utilising satellite technology to connect different locations in real time.
         Artists and performers from around the world participated, enabling audiences in the U.S., Europe, and Asia to experience the event 
         together.</p>
         <p class="research image-description">
        Paik's work demonstrated that television could serve as a platform for art, not just a medium for shows. The broadcast combined live
         performances, pre-recorded videos, and various artistic expressions, merging traditional TV with experimental art. It both celebrated 
         and critiqued technology's impact on culture and society. By broadcasting globally, Paik highlighted the ways in which media connects 
         people and influences our lives. His work, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning,_Mr._Orwell" target="_blank">
        "Good Morning, Mr. Orwell,"</a> anticipated how technology like TV and video could link people worldwide. It prefigured our current 
        social media platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and WhatsApp, where we can communicate through devices anytime and anywhere. Paik essentially
         predicted the future of digital media.</p>

            The phrase "ART MUST BE DESTRUCTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE" underscores the importance of questioning norms and embracing disorder. 
            But what is art? While I understand what it is, what does it mean to me?</p>
            <p class="research image-description">
                When I think about art, art embodies humanity itself. It's the human spirit that can't keep our thoughts and feelings inside
                 and has to express them. Art has been a constant companion since the dawn of humanity, and we can't live without it.
                Inspired by my art book, I thought about a project where users could deconstruct old and classic art and then recreate it.
                 They could destroy the art and recreate it again, much like creating a digital collage. And here's my sketch of the idea.</p>
