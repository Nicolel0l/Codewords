Reflective Statement

Before starting this class, I had no idea what creative coding was and had no coding experience. The afternoon coding class was fast-paced, and I was busy following the instructions rather than fully understanding them. There were some overwhelming moments, but I realised that it was the way to learn. I tried to make time outside of class to understand coding more.

What I was learning for the first few weeks seemed vague and uncertain. I often wondered how I could complete the project in such a short period of time. I am more used to practical design than artistic, so it took some time to adjust at first.

What really helped me was sharing my work in progress with others. This session helped me get out of the way where I often get stuck in very small details and do not see the big picture. Also, discussing the project with peers gave me new ideas and perspectives I had not considered. I learned how other people approach it in different ways, and that helped me improve my project.

I realised that learning to code was the only way to get through the uncertainty. My learning of HTML, CSS, and p5.js was slow, but I learned a lot in 12 weeks. One of the important lessons I learned from this studio is not to overthink things and just start. I also realised that neat documentation and file organisation are essential.

I always had problems with coding, and debugging took all day, with a lot of trial and error. This process was really frustrating at times and I wanted to give up, but I took a break and started all over again. This experience taught me perseverance and the ability to deal with difficulties while working.

I want to create my portfolio website. I also plan to continue improving my coding skills. I am currently thinking about working on an AR project, and I think I can apply a lot of skills that I learned from the studio. I also want to use what I learned to create more interactive designs.

This studio has been the most challenging but also the most rewarding class I have ever taken. There was a lot involved in finding text, understanding it, making it my own and expressing it as digital content. The results may be small and simple, but the process of creating it was not easy.

The manifesto for uncertain digital media that I chose was written in 1987, but it is still relevant to me today. Just like the sentence I chose, "Art must be destructive and constructive." this class made me destructive and constructive at times, and it was also an experience that made me realise what true learning is about. I will not waste the valuable skills and knowledge I have gained but will use and develop them.
